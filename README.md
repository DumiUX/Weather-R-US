# Weather-R-US
A solution to keep track of weather conditions

**How It Works:**

**Login System:**

    Users must log in with a username and password stored in the JavaScript file. 
    Dummy login credentials - username: "user", password: "pass123"
    Once logged in, the sidebar and dashboard become visible.

**Dashboard Layout:**
    
    A sidebar navigation menu (which becomes a bottom navigation bar on mobile).
    A top search bar for entering city names and a button for fetching the current location's weather.
    Sections displaying current weather, five-day forecasts, anomalies, wind speed, humidity and alerts.

  **Severe Weather Alerts:**

    Used color-coded warnings (red for severe storms, yellow for mild alerts).

**Customizable Dashboard:**
    Users can choose which weather data appears first they can add cities and info they would like displayed 

**Weather Anomalies & Trends:**
    Instead of just listing anomalies, the site provides a visual trend graph showing extreme weather changes over time.

**Mobile Responsiveness:**

    The sidebar transforms into a bottom navigation menu on mobile.
    The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience.
